## Project Description

Although I grew up in Los Angeles, there is not a lot I know about its complex history. This project will offer accessible digital learning experience of Los Angeles by enabling users to follow places through time. My goal is to suggest a ux design of mobile app where users can learn about LA’s rich history on the go
through searching by interest in history(e.g. Arts, Food, Politics) or location. (e.g. Hollywood, DTLA, Ktown). Due to LA's rich history as one of the biggest and most demographically diverse metropolitan cities in the world, many people have created various stories and media projects. But the projects have an overwhelming amount of text/information that is unorganized and indigestible. Therefore, I would like to propose an experience design of human-centered, easy to use and accessible, location-based information through a mobile context. In the process, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of previous works and user research to understand my target audiences’ needs. 

## Expected Outcome

In response to those needs, I will also create personas, journey maps and a prototype as a proof of design concept. This project would be beneficial to not only LA local residents but also visitors that would like to experience the past and present diverse LA.
